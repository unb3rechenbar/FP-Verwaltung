As the first continuously operating laser with a wavelength in the range of visible light ($\lambda \approx \SI{632.8}{\nm}$), the HeNe laser is a very important part of laser history and therefore a very interesting object to study.

The goal of our experiment is to gain a better understanding of the HeNe laser setup and more general laser principles. Studying the HeNe Laser and its responses to several changes in variables such as input current and resonator length, we are able to observe such basic properties of a the laser. Using prisms we later on isolate single wavelengths from the laser light and observe the fluorescence spectrum of the Helium Neon gas.
