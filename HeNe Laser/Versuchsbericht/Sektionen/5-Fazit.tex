    \subsubsection*{Current dependent output power}
        In this experiment we saw an increasing output power with increasing input current, which appeares to saturate everso slightly at the end. To confirm theoretical results we need to take a bigger frame of reference, as the saturation is not clearly visible in the given range. Furthermore we cannot safely assume a functional relationship of these two variables. Therefore, and because we failed to measure the initial offset $P_fl$, we only get an approximate value $P_0 = (8.2087\pm 30.8496)\;\si{\W}$ for the laser threshold.

        Another result was an almost linear decreasing relationship between the input current and the efficiency of the HeNe Laser.
