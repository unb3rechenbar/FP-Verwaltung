In this experiment, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is studied in a simple water probe. Firstly, parameters for a clear resonance signal are investigated. Using this signal, the relaxation times for spin-lattice- and spin-spin-relaxtion are measured. In the process of this, typical NMR-pulse sequences are familiarized: namley, the spin-echo and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence. Furthermore the im\\

An important application of NMR is in MRI
