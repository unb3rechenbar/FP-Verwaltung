In this experiment, we aim to make a partial map of the Milky Way. Since our own planet is contained within the galaxy, creating an image of the galaxys' structure is more tricky compare to other extraterrestial structures.

To achieve this goal, we use a radio antenna to receive waves emitted by hyperfine transitions of hydrogen atoms abundandly found in our galaxies' arms. The spectrum of those waves can ultimately provide information about the relative distance of the galaxies'  
arms to earth. The main result of the experiment is a map of the helium distribution within the first two galatic quadrant of the Milky Way.
