Using a AlGaAs diode laser to stimulate the Nd:YAG crystal we can observe multiple characteristics of thus structure and lasing abilities. By firstly measuring the absorbtion spectrum of the crystal we can determine the parameters for the AlGaAs laser and therefore conclude the optimal frequency of $808\si{\nm}$ for the pumping laser. We also get the opportunity to measure the lifetime of the excited state of the Nd:YAG crystal at $(250\pm 3.6)\si{\micro\s}$ by observing the decay of the population inversion.

Building the laser allows us to observe its output power as a function of the pumping power and to determine the threshold power of the Nd:YAG laser.
